# Archived Students Endpoint Test Results

**Date:** October 22, 2025  
**Test Status:** ✅ **PASSED**

---

## Summary

The archived students endpoint (`GET /students/archived/`) is now **working correctly** after fixing the routing conflict issue.

## Issue Fixed

### Problem
The `/students/archived/` endpoint had a **routing conflict** in FastAPI. The route was defined after the parameterized route `/{student_id}`, causing FastAPI to interpret "archived" as a student ID instead of a distinct endpoint.

### Solution
Reordered the routes in `app/api/students.py` so that:
1. `/students/` - List all students
2. **`/students/archived/`** - List archived students (moved before `/{student_id}`)
3. `/students/{student_id}` - Get specific student by ID

---

## API Endpoint Details

### Get Archived Students
- **URL:** `GET /students/archived/`
- **Authentication:** Required (Admin or Superadmin)
- **Query Parameters:**
  - `skip` (optional): Number of records to skip (default: 0)
  - `limit` (optional): Maximum number of records to return (default: 1000, max: 10000)
- **Response:** Array of StudentResponse objects with `is_archived = True`

### Example Request
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/students/archived/" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

### Example Response
```json
[
  {
    "id": 9,
    "name": "TestArchived",
    "surname": "Student",
    "second_name": "ForTesting",
    "starting_date": "2025-10-22",
    "num_lesson": 0,
    "total_money": 0.0,
    "courses": [],
    "attendance": [],
    "is_archived": true
  }
]
```

---

## What Works Now

✅ **Routing:** No conflicts between `/archived/` and `/{student_id}`  
✅ **Data Filtering:** Correctly returns only archived students (where `is_archived = True`)  
✅ **Authentication:** Properly enforces admin/superadmin access  
✅ **Response Format:** Returns correct StudentResponse schema  
✅ **Pagination:** Supports skip/limit query parameters  
✅ **Separation:** Archived students don't appear in regular `/students/` endpoint  

---

## Frontend Integration

Your frontend can now use this endpoint to:

1. **Fetch all archived students:**
   ```javascript
   const response = await fetch('http://your-api/students/archived/', {
     headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` }
   });
   const archivedStudents = await response.json();
   ```

2. **With pagination:**
   ```javascript
   const response = await fetch('http://your-api/students/archived/?skip=0&limit=50', {
     headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` }
   });
   ```

3. **Check the is_archived flag:**
   Each student object will have `"is_archived": true`

---

## Notes

- The fix required reordering route definitions in the FastAPI router
- No database changes were needed
- The `is_archived` field already existed in the Student model
- Students are "soft deleted" (archived) rather than permanently removed
- The CRUD functions (`get_archived_students`) were already implemented correctly

---

## Conclusion

The archived students endpoint is **fully functional** and ready for use in your frontend application. The routing conflict has been resolved, and all tests confirm the endpoint works as expected.
